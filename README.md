This is a program that makes you able to make a hash list with many different encryption methods (SHA256, SHA512, MD5, etc..) giving a word list to encrypt.
It also lets you find a coincidence between a hash that you input along with a word list and a hash list.
The UI is not the best but I don't like doing front-end stuff.

*THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY, I DO NOT CONDONE ANY KIND OF MALICIOUS USE OF THE PROGRAM*

## How to use

### Set a target file (.txt where you want the encrypted words) and word list (your .txt with the words you want to encrypt).

This is what a word list should look like for example:

![Word list example](../assets/wordlistexample.png?raw=true)

After pressing the buttons for choosing the files and choosing them it should look like this:

![Files chosen example](../assets/pathexamples.png?raw=true)


### Choose the encryption method you want your word list to be encrypted with
(your target file will receive the word list words encrypted with the method you choose)

![Encryption methods](../assets/encryptionmethodexample.png?raw=true)


### Press generate button

Your program should look like this before pressing the generate button:
