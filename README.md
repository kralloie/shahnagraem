This is a program that makes you able to make a hash list with many different encryption methods (SHA256, SHA512, MD5, etc..) giving a word list to encrypt.
It also lets you find a coincidence between a hash that you input along with a word list and a hash list.
The UI is not the best but I don't like doing front-end stuff.



##How to use

###Set a target file (.txt where you want the encrypted words) and word list (your .txt with the words you want to encrypt).

This is what a word list should look like for example: https://imgur.com/gallery/eufjA4k
